# From the plot we can see that the Setosa species generally has a shorter sepal and petal length than the 
# Versicolor and Virginica species. The Versicolor Species has moderate and Virginica species has a longer 
# sepal and petal length in general. We can also see a postive correlation between sepal length and petal 
# length for all species. As the sepal length increases, the petal length tends to increase as well.
