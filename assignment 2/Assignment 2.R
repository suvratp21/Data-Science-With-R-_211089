# From the scatterplot, we can observe that the three species of iris (setosa, versicolor, and virginica)
# are fairly distinguishable based on their sepal length and petal length measurements. Setosa generally
# has shorter sepal length and smaller petal length compared to the other two species. Versicolor tends
# to have intermediate values for both sepal length and petal length. Virginica typically has longer
# sepal length and larger petal length compared to the other species.

# Ship Type B has been in service for much longer compared to the other types of ships. Therefore it has
# a higher number of incidents simply because it has been in use for way longer than the other ships. We
# can check this by calculating the number of incidents per month of service for each ship type. From the
# given data we can see that ship type E is the least trustworthy ship. Therefore the hypothesis that ship
# type B is the least trustworthy ship as it has had the most number of accidents is false.
